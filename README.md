# Image-Caption-Generator
An image caption generator is a tool that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to generate descriptive captions for images. The CNN extracts visual features from the input images, while the LSTM processes these features to generate a natural language description.
