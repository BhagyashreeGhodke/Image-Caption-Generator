# Image-Caption-Generator
An image caption generator is a tool that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to generate descriptive captions for images. The CNN extracts visual features from the input images, while the LSTM processes these features to generate a natural language description.
The process involves training a model on a dataset of images and their corresponding captions. During training, the model learns to map image features to text sequences. Once trained, the model can generate captions for new images by first extracting features with the CNN and then using the LSTM to predict the next word in the caption sequence.
